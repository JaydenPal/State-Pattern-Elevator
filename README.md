# Description
This maven project was written for an assignment given to me in my Object Oriented Systems class. 
The goal was to use the state design pattern to simulate an elevator. The code handles user input
as buttons on an elevator. A user selects a number representing the floor they would like to go to
and the approproate actions and state changes are then made. 

Also included is a simple UML diagram of the project.

# Reflection
This code is only meant to handle the pressing of a single button at a time so buttons arent queued
up as they are pressed. The reason for this was that it was simply beyond the scope of the assignment
but I do not think it would be hard to extend the code to able to provide such behavior. You can even
just extend the FloorHandler class to achieve this. The state design pattern was simple enough but I
often have this thought as I learn new design patterns. The patterns are things you could discover on
your own by coding and they seem so obvious but only after it is brought to my attention. Then it is like
a light bulb and I can see its use case in many places, even in my past coding projects.
